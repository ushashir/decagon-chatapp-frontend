### **Dev Contribution Guide**
1. Clone the repository
2. Clone and then open it up on your prefered code editor
3. Open your terminal & set the upstream branch: `git remote add upstream git@github.com:decadevs/week-8-mini-project-group_6.git`
4. Pull upstream `git pull upstream develop`
5. Create a new branch for the user story you're working on eg : `git checkout -b login-page`

7. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message : `git commit -m "your commit message"`.
8. To update your local `develop` with the one on github, Run `git pull`
9. Push changes to your new branch : `git push origin login-page`
10. Create a pull request to the `develop` branch.


### **Folder Structure**
For the BackEnd of this project, all you truly need to worry about is the `backend` folder & the `server.js` file.

```  

    ├── frontend
    ├── server
    ├── socket

```

We are using MVC framework, all `frontend` will be in `frontend` forder while all `backend` logic will be in `server` folder and `socket` in `socket` folder.

Run `cd frontend` to navigate to `frontend` folder 
Run `cd backend` to navigate to `backend` folder 
Run `cd socket` to navigate to `socket` folder 

Make sure you are in root directory before pushing to github.
